2. QUESTION/OBSERVATION 2 As mentioned in The End of Books, “It is the duty of art, whether by music or poetry or painting, at any cost to carry us beyond ourselves.” Does this mean that books carry some sort of spiritual purpose? 
3. QUESTION/OBSERVATION 3 As mentioned in The Universal Page when referring to Braille, “He might have thought of it as universal, but it’s universal in that way that the colonizer thinks things are universal.” Does this mean that Braille was only accessible to certain groups of people?
