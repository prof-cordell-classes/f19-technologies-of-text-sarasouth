## Questions or Observations

1. Borsuk states, “Books are political tools.” To what extent can books therefore manipulate an audience?
2. As Carron states in The New Art of Making Books, “A book is a series of spaces, a sequence of moments.”Does this suggest that a book is similar to a film in the sense that each sequence or moment tells a story?
3. Viscomi states, “Printing illuminated books were still possible, but more difficult than before because they demanded greater artistic attention, disrupted other work, and required more space.” How did illuminated books encourage codices to become an art form?
