 ## Questions or Observations

1. QUESTION/OBSERVATION 1 Price states that, “21st century researchers stated that when it comes to mood boosting, neither the content nor the form of literature matters so much as the medium of print.” Does this mean that books can boost one’s mood?

2. QUESTION/OBSERVATION 2 Chesnutt states, “One can scarcely discuss any subject of importance without unconsciously borrowing, now and then, the thoughts of the language of others. Quotation, like imitation, is a superior grade of flattery.” Does this mean that all the ideas from extraordinary books have been borrowed from past books? Does this indicate that there is a lack of originality when considering the book as an idea?

3. QUESTION/OBSERVATION 3 Chesnutt states, “The smaller the edition, the greater the collector’s eagerness to acquire a copy.” Was this due to the fact that the compactness made it easier to carry and travel with?
