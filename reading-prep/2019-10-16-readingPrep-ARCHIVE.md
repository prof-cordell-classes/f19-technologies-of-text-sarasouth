## Questions or Observations

1. Mak states that “Blank space is crucial to the activity of reading, and especially silent reading, because it enhances the legibility and comprehensibility of the page.” To what extent is it crucial to consider the blank spaces within a page? How does that engage the reader?
2. Cushman states that “Acts of linguistic perseverance can and should be seen as addressing the real threat of language erosion and extinction that so many tribal languages face.” To what extent does speaking Cherokee, or any Native-American language for that matter persevere through speaking orally rather than through writing?
3. Mak also states that “The page is more than a simple vehicle or container for the transmission of ideas; it is a part of those ideas, entangled in the story itself.” Does this mean that the page is also telling a story based on the way it’s structured and organized?
