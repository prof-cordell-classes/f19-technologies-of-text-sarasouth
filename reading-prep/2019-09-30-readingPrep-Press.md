## Questions or Observations

1. QUESTION/OBSERVATION 1 In Dinius’s article, Look!! Look!!! at This!!!!’: The Radical Typography of David Walker’s Appeal, she states “Typographic features help readers follow the pamphlet’s instructions to spread its word.” This brought me to the question of, to what extent are typographic features still evident in print today?
2. QUESTION/OBSERVATION 2 In Faithfull’s article, Women Compositors, she states that there was a “dreaded increase of competition in the labor market,” particularly in regards to women working in the Victorian Press. However, it was then deemed that this was not true. Rather, it’s evident that this increased the productive power of the country at the time. 
3. QUESTION/OBSERVATION 3 In Leah Price’s codex, What We Talk About When We Talk About Books, she states that there is a clear resale value in books. Is it elitist to have a collection of books, rather than reading and then getting rid of a book?
