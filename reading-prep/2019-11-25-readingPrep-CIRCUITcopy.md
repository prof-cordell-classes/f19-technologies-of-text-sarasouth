## Questions or Observations

1. QUESTION/OBSERVATION 1 As mentioned in Future Reading, “The way we consume media changes over time.” To what extent do these different modalities of media affect the way we interpret the same information?
2. QUESTION/OBSERVATION 2 As mentioned in Future Reading, “I would read and take notes on the Kindle in bed, in a tent, on a train. It was an incredible user experience, delightful in its absurdity.” Was the accessibility what made the Kindle so useful? The fact that you could annotate without a pen, or read without a light?
3. QUESTION/OBSERVATION 3 What Football Will Look Like In The Future allows us to question the way in which we use media to communicate with each other. As time passes, we still continue to use communication as a means to tell individuals how we feel.
