## Questions or Observations

1. QUESTION/OBSERVATION 1: As stated in Vee’s Computer Programming article, “Programming is writing because it is symbols inscribed on a surface, but programming is also not writing, or rather, it is something more than writing, as the symbols that constitute computer code are designed not only to be read but also to be executed, or run, by the computer.” Can we really consider programming a form of writing if it’s not meant to be read by humans?


2. QUESTION/OBSERVATION 2:  Aelfric implies in his translation of Genesis that translation is dangerous. To what extent can meaning be lost through translation in writing?

3. QUESTION/OBSERVATION 3: As mentioned in Amaranth Borsuk’s, The Book as Object, she states, “Authors do not write books, they write texts that become written objects, manuscripts, inscriptions, print matter, or today, material in a computer file.” Does this mean that in fact, the format of a book does not matter, but rather, the content?
