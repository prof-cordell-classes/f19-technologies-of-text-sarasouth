## Questions or Observations

1. QUESTION/OBSERVATION 1 In Chris Gayomali’s article titled “How Typeface Influences the Way We Read and Think,” it’s clear that we must consider to what extent the context and purpose of fonts affect how we interpret research. However, how does this compare to Borsuk’s statement “a book is a machine to think with?” Does this change our ability to interpret text?
2. QUESTION/OBSERVATION 2 In Stephen Fry’s “The Machine That Made Us,” he states, “that it must be hard to imagine what life would have been like before printing.” However, in Borsuk’s previous chapter discussing “The Book as Object,” it’s clear that texts were still scribed in a variety of manners, such as manuscripts, scribes, etc.
3. QUESTION/OBSERVATION 3 In Amaranth Borsuk’s chapter from The Book, titled “The Book as Content,” she states “books were finally seen as a technological innovation.” Was this due to the fact that books were finally becoming privatized and no longer shared publicly?
