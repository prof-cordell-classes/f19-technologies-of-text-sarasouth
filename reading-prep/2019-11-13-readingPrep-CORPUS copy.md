## Questions or Observations

1. QUESTION/OBSERVATION 1 In What Gets Counted Counts, D’Ignazio and Klein state, “We live in a world in which “data-driven” decisions are prioritized over anecdotal ones, and “evidence”--Fox News notwithstanding--is taken to mean “backed up by numbers and facts.”” Does this mean that numbers are more important than words in our society?
2. QUESTION/OBSERVATION 2 In What Gets Counted Counts, they state, “The Golden Gate Bridge is a physical structure; Facebook Ads is a virtual structure; and the gender binary is a conceptual one. But each of these structures was created by people: people living in a particular place, at a particular time, and who were influenced--as we all are-- by the world around them.” Therefore, the gendered structures within our society can therefore be transformed and altered. However, why aren’t they?
3. QUESTION/OBSERVATION 3 In Ryan Cordell and Abby Mullen’s Fugitive Verses, they state, “As this joke implies, the term “fugitive” insists that poems within the exchange system should have authors—or owners—but that the newspaper’s material and social operations undermine such controls.” This led me to the question, how do we determine ownership in texts?
