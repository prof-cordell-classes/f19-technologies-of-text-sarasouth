## Questions or Observations

1. QUESTION/OBSERVATION 1: In Leah Price’s book, she states, “Ebooks were perceived as fake, as they possessed the function of a codex without the form,” however, I found this to be a contradictory statement, as she later states that, “Like candles, books stand as an artifact, an object of the past,” this brought me to the question of “What really is the true difference between an ebook and a codex? How has the ebook revolutionized our ideas about reading?

2. QUESTION/OBSERVATION 2:  In Ken Lu’s short story, he outlines that one fictional group of aliens, known as The Caru’ee, acquire books that have lost all meaning. This made me question, whether, in fact, we, as humans do the same thing, by studying “dead literature,” such as Latin, for instance. To what extent is it significant to analyze or understand books that no longer bear meaning?

3. QUESTION/OBSERVATION 3: As mentioned in Ken Lu’s short story, he states that the Allations believed that “reading is like hearing a voice from the past,” similarly to how in Plato’s selection from Socrates’ dialogue with Phaedrus, he believed that the “purpose of writing down memories was to prevent the forgetfulness of old age.” Therefore, I was wondering, does reading only provide us insight of the past, or rather, does reading also provide insight of our own present and future?
