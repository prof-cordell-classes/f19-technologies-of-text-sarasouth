# Lab Report: Multisensory Reading

#### Sara South

## Process Description

In this lab, we analyzed five different pieces of blocks of text, to understand how language can be felt, rather than read. The blocks of text were covered, so we could not see the images or text of the blocks. After observing and feeling each of the blocks, some of which had images, and some of which were classical texts, such as Hamlet, it became clear how truly difficult it is to analyze and read through the kinesthetic touch, when you are used to reading with your eyes.

## Observations

I found the process of reading the texts and viewing the images with my fingers to be particularly frustrating as this was something that I had never encountered before. However, I felt it led me to question and consider what are the limitations of reading, specifically with people who are blind, or for individuals who require assistive technology to help them read. 

Furthermore, I noticed there is a clear difference between reading images vs. reading text. Reading a braille image is very difficult if you don't already recognize the specific image, for instance, a circle with rays can be interepreted as the sun. Moreover, the distance between the letters and the font of the text also affect one's ability to read and interpret these blocks of text. 


## Analysis

 
As Uzanne mentions in The End of Books, the question of the end of books has been considered for centuries. She states, "Either the books must go, or they must swallow us up." However, the end of the printed book only resulted in more modalities of reading and interpreting the same text. In our lab, we read Hamlet in Braille, therefore indicating another form of assistive technology of reading a text. Nowadays, we could watch an adaptated film of Hamlet, or listen to an e-book of Hamlet. This allows us to interpret and engage with texts in new modalities and ways, indicating the significance of this lab.


As Sara Hendren mentions in All Technology Is Assistive: Six Design Rules on Disability, disability studies is important to understand when analyzing multisensory reading, as some individuals are not able to read through vision. Many individuals argue that reading an e-book doesn't mean that you've read the book, but it's extremely insensitive to say that if you haven't read a book through vision, then you haven't read a book at all. Therefore, even though the braille was difficult to read for myself, braille was extremely transformative in helping indivuals read through touch, and to allow individuals who are blind to educate themselves. Not to mention, all technology is in fact assistive technology, and not just for people who aren't able-bodied. A smartphone is assistive, so are eyeglasses and headphones. These technologies are assisting us in "multiple registers, enabling and augmenting a sensory experience." Therefore, braille should not be seen as a form of multisensory reading for people who are blind, but rather as a form of assistive technology as any other form of text, allowing us to engage with and learn the information and content at hand.


As mentioned in The Universal Page, the first machine-embossed book was created for the blind, similarly to what we were analyzing and trying to read in this lab. "It was written in print that sighted readers could also understand, bu the text was raised so blind students could feel the shape of the letters." This therefore, implemented the idea that blind people could be systematically educated, and thus this lab, and braille, acts as a form of assistive technology.
