# Lab Report: MARK DOWN LAB

#### Sara South

## Process Description

This lab was conducted to understand how to utilize the Github software to create repositories and share our work. Ultimately, this started with downloading the Github software, and connecting to Professor Cordell's Technology of Text Repository. Once connected, we had to select clone on the Github sotware, and then download the repositories by opening it on the desktop. After opening it, we downloaded the Github Desktop App, allowing us to then connect our Github repositories with our computer's hard drive and the internet. Once this was done, we was able to open the template that was provided and duplicate it to begin writing the lab report. We also downloaded the Mac Down software from the Apple Store to aid us in typing in the coding language correctly. To add a screenshot we had taken into my lab report, we had to add the image into the images folder, where we then had to add coding language detailing the title of the photo, and then mention its location in coding language. To upload the final document, we saved it in our folder, so the final version would appear on the Github Desktop App. Once the final version was on the Github Desktop App, we titled it "Submit Lab 1", where we then selected "Commit to master," where we then selected "Push origin", which uploaded the final version to the Github Repository online.

## Observations

After completing this lab, I am now able to view the idea of programming and coding language in a completely new way. Since coding language is essentially meant to be read by a computer, I was a bit worried. I was a bit terrified at first before completing the lab, as I was unable to open text edit, and unable to understand how writing in code would translate onto an actual document. Once I had downloaded Mac Down, it provided me a side by sde comparison of how the lab report will look on the Github website, making text edit much easier to utilize. 

Two particularly interesting aspects of coding that I learned were, how to create a block quote, and how to add images. If I want to create a block quote, I need to use a carat (<) on a new line, and this will allow me to highlight a particular quote. Adding images is even simpler, where I drag the image into the image repository on my laptop, and then write it into the lab using code, and describing the location of the image, ie (/images/lighttyping.jpg), for instance.

After finishing the lab and uploading my first version of a lab report onto Github, I was quite surprised and delighted with myself for being able to learn coding language after one class. I was worried that I may develop technological issues along the way, or that I would be discouraged by the format, however, I discovered that once Professor Cordell explained the function behind the form, I was able to comprehend how coding language can create a website or document, and transform it into a new digital format.

## Analysis

After completing this lab, it's evident that computer programminghas revolutionized the way we communicate our ideas. As mentioned in Leah Price's codex, <i> What We Talk About When We Talk About Books </i>, she states that,
<blockquote> "Perhaps print is to digital as Madonna is to whore: we worship one but use the other." </blockquote>

Although we may worship codices due to the particular nostalgic and communal aspects of sitting down and reading in a printable format, free of distractions, digital tools have revolutioned how we communicate with the world. Github, a technological software that allows us to write in HTML, has aided me in understanding the function of the computer, and how it's revolutionizing the various formats and platforms that we communicate on.

Github works very similarly to the way a Tumblr blog may function, or even Twitter. As Socrates mentioned in Plato's <i> Selection From Phaedrus, </i> codices don't speak back, they don't argue. In today's revolutionized and digitized world, we are able to speak back like we had never been able to before. Although there was always a way to possibly get in touch with the author or a codex, commenting on a Facebook post, or providing feedback on a lab report has allowed us to speak back at lightening fast speeds. Ultimately, this has allowed regular people, not just merely writers, to develop their own unique opinions, voices, and perspectives. Due to the accessibility of the modern computer (at least in the Western World), I've gone years without ever needing to learn HTML or coding language. However, after completing this lab, I'm delighted at the sheer appreciation I have towards the computer, and its ability to process programming language to create digitized, textual formats that revolutionize our world and the way we communicate with one another. 

As Marshall McLuhan states in <i> The Medium Is The Message, </i> 

<blockquote> "Cultural metric is just as important as content". </blockquote> McLuhan emphasizes that it's important for us to consider the political and social consequences of a revolutionized way of processing text. Although we tend to emphasize the value of the content that is said online, or read on a computer, the medium itself is, in fact, <b> the message. </b> The mere fact that I am using coding language to create a new textual format and to write a lab report, in itself, is revolutionizing the way I'm able to understand and communicate my ideas into new formats.
