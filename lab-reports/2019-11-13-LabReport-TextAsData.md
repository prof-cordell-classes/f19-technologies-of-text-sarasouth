# Lab Report: Text As Data

#### Sara South

## Process Description

In this lab, I began by logging into rstudio.library.northeastern.edu on my computer, with the username and password provided by Prof. Cordell, where we are working in the programminglanguage R. I then went to tools, r markdown, and unselected the "show output inline" button. This allowed us to weave together prose and chunks of code in order to create literate programming. I opened the lab 9 text as data document to begin. To run a line of code from the existing document, I'd select run, and run a selected line as it's easier to do it line by line. The function of this particular code is "print" which displays the words. In this case, I wrote print("HelloWorld!") as my first set of code, and then hitting CTRL and enter to run the code. In order to use the packages that have been installed, I had to load them using the library function within the code. Then, I ran the chunk of code known as "barton <- tibble," which added data to the environment, known as a variable. This allowed the tibble, a form of a data structure, to connect it to the link to the Gutenberg website. It's important to note that these names are arbitrary. As we run the text, it's clear that the r's and n's represent spaces, and can be removed with "gsub." By then using gutenbergdownload, I could see the text in a more readable format. To create my own data set, I had to use the existing code, and select a different Gutenberg code, and then I was able to run it to therefore create my own. Then, I ran he code that determiend the frequency of the words within the text, using words and tokens.

## Observations

I found the process to be quite intimidating at first. This is due to the fact that when I first opened the software, there was a plethora of chunks of text and code combined. Considering I have no base knowledge of programming, this was quite worrisome at first. However, as I read through the lab data that Prof. Cordell provided, he explained the R programming language in extensive detail, making it easier to follow. Therefore, I found this process to be easier to follow than expected as I was told where to run the text by following the document. I really enjoyed using the programming language R because I can type directly into the console window, and running the code is as easy as clicking a button.

I did however, find it particularly frustrating that I had no base knowledge of computer language programming, and this made me realize how completely illiterate I am in this language. One of the potential problems when exploring computational analysis is that I cannot tell the difference between the metadata in Project Gutenberg and Eliott's original text. By using gutenbergdownload, this changes the format. Therefore, it's clear that restructuring the computational language makes it much easier to pull the metadata of these texts.

## Analysis

In Sydney Padua's, The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage: The (Mostly) True Story of the First Computer, Lovelace extrapolated the numbers from data to the way they could represent other things, such as: language or music," as she begins to believe that this symbolic language of computing begins to be applied to other domains. This relates to the lab as we used the R programming language to learn more about texts, not necessarily to use math. With the help of modern programming, it gives us greater insight into how manipulate texts and how textual structure is created. 

Furthermore, Babbage and Lovelace imagined storing variables on physical cards, that could then be used as a form of computation, which is similar to this lab when R variables are stored in my computer's working memory. What I find most fascinating is how Lovelace used an act of imagination and understood how the computer would function without it existing. This is quite interesting as I feel data in my eyes is conceptual, although it is in fact a tangible form, due to the use of modern computers.

In Padua's book, footnotes are used, which are juxtaposed with the fantastical graphic novel portion of the codex. The book aims to create a hierarchy of form, while computer may be useful, it's in fact useful to me. The footnotes are necessary to understand the book, and helps sell Lovelace's perspective on this. The footnotes sell as a metacommentary, as most of the story is being told through the footnotes, emphasizing and highlighting the personality and tone of the book. Often, footnotes are just citations in academic papers. However, similarly to how these Gutenberg texts are restructured throgh comptuer programming langauge and data, Lovelace's text is restructured and repurposed through Padua's graphic novel format combined with footnotes, therefore transmitting the same information in a completely new format.

As stated on page 25, Lovelace states, "A new, a vast, and a powerful language is developed for the future of analysis, in which to wield its truths! Almost a...poetical science.” This brought me to the question of, do humans need to understand algorithms? In my opinion, not so much. However, I do believe that humans should understand the transformations the algorithms enact, and how that restructures data, without necessarily being fluent in a computaitonal language.
